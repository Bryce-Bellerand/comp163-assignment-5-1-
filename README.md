# I used a while loop for the first part because the amount of iterations change a lot based on the input

# meanwhile I used a for loop for the second test case because I knew the amount of iterations that had to happen from the beginning.

# for the final test case, I used a nested for loop because I again knew beforehand the amount of iterations each row and column needed for the correct output

# light AI usage to correct areas of code that weren't outputting properly
